	* (bgp.py) extended length attributes actually didn't work; now
	  they do (tickled by parsing recent RouteViews data where
	  MP_REACH_NLRI and MP_UNREACH_NLRI fields are to be found)

	* (bgp.py) also fixed situations when NLRI field was prematurely
	  truncated (I believe this relates to a Zebra bug in
	  bgpd/bgp_dump.c where the allocated buffer doesn't allow space
	  for the type specific header in addition to max. packet size and
	  common header; gets tickled by UPDATES which are close to max
	  packet size) 

	* new release: 2.5

	* finished table-dump.py, few bug fixes

        * failure detection scripts + matlab; weight change scripts

        * new release: 2.4

2002-02-05  Richard Mortier  <mort@sprintlabs.com>

        * new release: 2.3

	* (table-dump.py) added table-dump.py enabling creation of RIB
	  dumps from (single) UPDATE streams
	
        * (splice.py) ditto

        * (mrtd.py) realised that timestamping is confused -- MRT
          packet timestamps are seconds-since-UTC, filenames are
          localtime; henceforth, all shall be based on
          seconds-since-UTC.
	
	* ChangeLog begins!  released version is 2.2
